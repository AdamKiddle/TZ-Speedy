Speedrun timer application I started writing in 2013 in Java. Fully customisable colours and layout, saves split files and preferences.

Many bugs, will get around to fixing these at some point.

## Startup
When you open the timer for the first time you will be prompted to create a preferences file. After that, you will see the timer in simple view and you can use the hotkeys listed below to use the timer.

Opening or creating a new split file will allow you to access complex view which includes splits and full customisability.

## Hotkeys

### In simple view:
Key      | description
--- | ---
x        | Start/Stop Timer
q        | Reset Timer
CTRL + O | Open a split file (Turns into complex view)
CTRL + N | Create new split file (Turns into complex view)

### In complex view:
Key      | description
-------- | ------------
CTRL + O | Open a split file
CTRL + N | Create new split file
CTRL + D | Opens up preferences, allows setting custom keycodes for splitting

In the preferences screen you can choose color preferences and custom hotkeys.
(use [keycode.info](https://keycode.info/) to find keycodes for different keys).
